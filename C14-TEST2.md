# Task 2

**Some people say that the main environmental problem of our time is the loss of particular species  plants and animals. others say that there are more important environmental problems.**  

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

There are diverse perspectives on the most important environment problem and here is a brief introduction.  

Some people believe that the extinction of certain species matter the most when it comes to the impact on environment. According to some biologist and environmentalist, the balance of ecological system depends on the interaction between species and environment. In other words, the mere disappearance of one little insect would seriously affect the eco-system it belongs. On top of that, the food chain will also be incomplete in a period of time, causing even more species to extinct. All these changes will eventually bring catastrophe to the environment.

However, there is also a group of people who holds the opposite opinion that we should focus on other environmental problem. They argue that problem such as carbon emission and micro-plastic pollution are more important problems. For example, studies haven shown that carbon emission have drastically risen in the past decades , causing greenhouse effect which increase the global temperature and destroy many animal habitats, consequently jeopardizing the survival of many species.
What really concern the public is that there are more of those kinds of problems recent years.


As far as i am concerned, I think that the latter opinion is more appropriate to some extent.
It is obvious that the extinction of species mainly comes from the destruction of their habitat, which result from other environmental problem such as carbon emission. So it is vital for us to concentrate on these problems first in order to maintain the habitat for many species, enabling them to reproduce without human intervene. In this way the eco-system will restore its condition on its own.  

In conclusion, the most urgent matter that need international cooperation is to deal with problem like carbon emission that harms the environment. I hope that joint effort will make earth a better place for species to live.

#### 绪论

<em><font color=red>（topic）</font></em> The issue of environment degradation is multifaceted, and opinions on the main environmental problem of our time vary. Some argue that the critical concern lies in the loss of specific plant and animal species, while other contend that broader environmental issues take precedence. <em><font color=red>（my opinion）</font></em> I believe that while the loss of species is undoubtedly a concerning issue with long-term implications, it is imperative(urgent) to address the broader environmental problem that contributes to biodiversity loss.


#### 本论1
<em><font color=red>（反对观点及理由）</font></em> On the one hand, advocates for the preservation of specific species emphasize the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the loss of even one species greatly affects the stability of whole system. <em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em>They argue that the extinction of a particular species can have cascading effects, disrupting the balance of the ecosystem and potentially leading the decline of other species. This perspective underscores the intrinsic value of biodiversity, emphasizing its role in maintaining ecological stability and resilience. <em><font color=red>（举例）</font></em> The theoretical prove of this view is that all the species in the ecosystem can be divided into three categories:
producer which produce oxygen and take in carbon dioxide, consumer that consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide, and decomposer which feed on the corpse of producer and consumer. Each of them play indispensable role in the food chain od ecosystem. The extinction of one species will bring catastrophic result.



#### 本论2

<em><font color=red>（赞成观点及理由）</font></em> Nevertheless, it is more urgent to solve broader environment issues such as climate changes, deforestation, and pollution for these problems can rapidly devastate the ecosystem and cause the number of species drastically falls.
<em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em> Thus, immediate action must be taken to stop those problem to restore the sustainability and resilience of ecosystem or the biodiversity will be destroyed in the near future, causing much more harm than the loss of some specific species.
<em><font color=red>（举例）</font></em> For instance， temperature rising in recent years resulting from the unlimited carbon emission have endangered more than ten thousands of species across the world, which definitely is more detrimental than the endangerment of some lions in african caused by illegal hunting.


#### 结论

<em><font color=red>（结语）</font></em> To sum up ,while it is undoubtedly important to protect some endangered species, the more urgent mission calling for international cooperation ought to be broader environmental issues like greenhouse effect.





# Task 1

## Body 


#### first section(topic introduction)
The bar graph illustrate the export earnings in different categories during  2015 and 2016 and the table shows the percentage change of the earings in the bar graph 


#### second section(overall feature)

Overall, it is clear that in most categories the export earnings increase slightly in 2016 , in which the Engineered goods and Textiles grows relatively high compared to the other two categories. Also according to the table the Textiles increases at the highest rate of 15.24 percent, followed by Engineer goods which have the rate of 8.5 percent. The Petroleum products ranks the third, increasing at 3 percent. The last one is Agricultural products which almost stays the same with last year, increasing only 0.81 percent. It is noticeable that the only decreasing category is the gems and jewellery which drop at the rate of 5.18 percent.


#### third section(specific feature of each year)

looking at the graph more closely, one can see that  in both 2015 and 2016, the highest earning comes from the petroleum products, close behind is the engineer goods. Next we can see a clear drop in earnings coming from Gems and jewellery. The last two is Agricultural products and textiles, both earns merely around 30 billion dollar, trivial compared to the first two categories.
