# Task 1
## Body
#### section 1 （topic）


The diagram shows the process of electricity-generation in a hydroelectric power station.


#### section 2 (overall feature)

overall，the process can be seen as the transition of water between High-level-reservoir controlled by Dam and the low level-reservoir connected to the power station. The station consists of a generator generating electricity, power lines that transmit the electricity to national grid, and Reversible turbines moving water in different direction. All these parts work together to ensure the supply of electricity.


#### section 3 (detailed process)

Looking at the diagram more closely, we can see that the whole process begin at night when the reversible turbines pump the water from the low-reservoir into high-level reservoir. At this point, the intake is closed and the water is stored in the high-level reservoir to accumulate enough potential energy, enabling the water flow to generate power in the Day to come. Next when the day come the intake opens and let the water flow down to the low-reservoir, at the same time reversing the turbines which then operating the generator to generate electricity until night come, ending this circulation, and another repetition begins.
