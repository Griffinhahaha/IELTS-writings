While it's true that digital technology has transformed the way we access and consume information, I don't entirely agree that printed newspapers or books will become obsolete in the future. Here's why:

Preference for Tangibility: Many people still enjoy the tactile experience of holding a physical newspaper or book. The smell of the paper, the act of turning pages, and the aesthetic appeal of printed materials can't be replicated by digital formats. Some readers find comfort and pleasure in the physicality of traditional print media.

Niche Markets and Collectors: There will likely always be niche markets and collectors who appreciate the value and uniqueness of printed newspapers or books. Limited edition prints, special editions, and rare publications hold sentimental or historical significance for collectors and enthusiasts.

Digital Divide: Despite advancements in technology, there are still segments of the population, particularly in rural or developing areas, who have limited access to the internet or digital devices. Printed materials remain essential for ensuring access to information and literacy for these populations.

Permanence and Reliability: Printed newspapers and books offer a level of permanence and reliability that digital formats sometimes lack. Physical copies can't be easily altered or deleted, making them a trusted source of information for archival purposes or historical reference.

Reader Preferences and Habits: While digital consumption is on the rise, many readers still prefer the experience of reading from printed materials. Some find it easier to concentrate and retain information when reading from a physical book or newspaper, without the distractions that come with digital screens.

That said, it's undeniable that digital media has significantly impacted the publishing industry, and online platforms offer unparalleled convenience and accessibility for readers. However, rather than rendering printed newspapers or books obsolete, I believe we'll continue to see a coexistence of digital and print formats, each serving different needs and preferences within society.

#### 绪论

<em><font color=red>（引入）</font></em>Opinions had that in the future the printed media like newspaper and books will be eliminated, people will only be reading digital copies. <em><font color=red>（我的观点）</font></em> Although it may be a logical assumption to some extent, I firmly believe that printed media is undoubtedly an indispensable part of human civilization.


#### 本论1

<em><font color=red>（原因1）</font></em> To begin with, people tend to have a preference for tangibility which means they will still be attracted by the tactile experience of holding a book and newspaper in the future.<em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em>  The smell of the paper, the act of turing pages, and the aesthetic appeal to the printed materials have long been inscribed in our souls, which cant be replicated by digital formats. <em><font color=red>（举例）</font></em> For example, recent survey has shown that although the market of digital books is growing faster year by year, the traditional printed books still have its niche market and collectors.


#### 本论2

<em><font color=red>（原因2）</font></em> On top of that, Printed medias offer a level of permanence and reliability. <em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em>while digital copies of newspaper and books could be altered or deleted, physical materials on the contrary are trusting source of information for archival purposes or historical reference.
<em><font color=red>（举例）</font></em> For example, when you buy a digital copy of book from an online e-book store, you don't really own the book, instead you just have the right to read it so basically this right can be taken back when the online store closed for some unknown reasons. However, buying a printed one is the other way around, preserved properly, a printed book could stay on your shelf for decades, and it wont be lost simply because the bookstore where you bought it close down.





#### 结论

<em><font color=red>（总结两个原因）</font></em>To sum it up, printed books not only provide people with a sense of tangibility, but also serve as a reliable source of information.
<em><font color=red>（结语）</font></em> It is indisputable that digital media has significantly impacted the publishing industry, however i firmly believe that we'll continue to see a coexistence of digital and printed forms, each serving different needs and preference of society.

The line graph shows the number of tourists visiting a caribbean island during 2010 and 2017.

#### overall features

overall, it is clear that the total visitors have seen a stable growth in the past 7 years, while the visitors staying on the island fluctuated between approximately 0.75 millions and 1.5 millions. As for the visitors staying on the cruise ship, apart from a drop/dip/fall/decline/decrease/go down/plummet/shrink of roughly 0.25 millions in the 2012, the number grows/go up/rise/increase/ascend steadily.

Looking at the graph more closely, we can see that the visitors staying on the island didn't increase in the 2011 and then went up moderately from 2011 to 2013. Next, after staying at 1.5 millions for three years, the number declined suddenly in 2016 but soon went back to 1.5 millions in 2017. Differently, the visitors staying on the cruise ship fluctuated between 0.25 and
0.5 in the  first four years but then started to grow steadily.
In 2016, one can see that the number of visitors staying on the cruise ships finally surpassed the number of visitors staying on the island.
