#### 绪论

<em><font color=red>（引入）</font></em> Life nowadays is becoming unprecedentedly overwhelmed by advertisement all over the place. And opinions on advertising about whether it is of use to attract people into buying vary from person to person.
<em><font color=red>（我的观点）</font></em> From my perspective, the belief that the advertisement is so common that we don't even notice it anymore is just a mislead of the fact that those advertising content have already infiltrated into every face od your life and subconsciously  lead you to purchase the product. So the former opinion is some how more persuading.


#### 本论1

<em><font color=red>（反对观点及理由）</font></em> On the one hand, it is true to some point that we no longer pay attention to floods of advertisement because it is so common and tedious. <em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em>long have the time passed for those tv commercial advertisement occupying our time. Nowadays manufacturer have changed their strategy to advertise, and fill the internet with their advertising content. However， it gives us an option to just skip those contents so obviously many of us will receive less advertisement when we browse on the internet compared to decades ago when our parents who had to endure the annoying commercials to watch their favorite tv programme. <em><font color=red>（举例）</font></em> For example， many content creator on video platform like youtube includes advertisement in their videos, and at most time you can neglect those parts so to some extent this kind of advertising is not as useful to many people.


#### 本论2

<em><font color=red>（赞成观点及理由）</font></em> Nevertheless， despite the fact that many people try to avoid commercials, the strategies modern advertising industry is using still have a tremendous implication. <em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em> Apart from those implicit commercials, there are actually many explicit ones such as a cup in one scene of a movie and in the lyrics of the song you are hearing. Compared to the traditional advertisement, those advertisement  are far less annoying, and may leave someone with less impression at the same time. However, these seemingly trivial means to advertise are not set for the purpose to instantly appeal someone, but to effect on a subconscious level and gradually arouse one's desire to purchase the product. <em><font color=red>（举例）</font></em>For example， suppose that you are watching a tv series and the shampoo that the protagonist uses everyday is exactly what the manufacturer want to advertise. So maybe at first you are not impressed with it, but one day after watching another episode in the night and you coincidentally find that your shampoo bottle has already been empty. And the next day when you go to the supermarket for a bew bottle, there is a big chance that u'ii choose the brand that u see on tv. After that you are likely to keep buying it without realizing this new habit of buying is cultivated because of a silly tv show.

#### 结论

<em><font color=red>（结语）</font></em> To sum it up, while the advertisement is more common than ever before, it still exerts a peculiar implication on people more or less.

Both perspectives on advertising hold validity and depend on various factors:

Effectiveness of Advertising in Persuasion:

Proponents of this view argue that advertising is highly successful in influencing consumer behavior. Through strategic messaging, compelling visuals, and targeted marketing techniques, advertisers can create a desire for products or services and persuade individuals to make purchasing decisions they might not have otherwise considered.
Advertising employs psychological tactics such as emotional appeal, social proof, and persuasive language to tap into consumers' desires and influence their buying behavior. Brands invest significant resources in market research and advertising campaigns to maximize their impact and drive sales.
Saturation and Desensitization to Advertising:

Conversely, critics argue that advertising has become so pervasive in modern society that people have developed a resistance to its influence. With the constant bombardment of advertisements across various media channels, from television and radio to the internet and social media, consumers have become adept at filtering out or ignoring advertising messages.
The sheer volume of advertisements encountered on a daily basis has led to a phenomenon known as "advertising clutter," where messages blend together, making it challenging for brands to stand out and capture consumers' attention. As a result, many individuals may tune out or actively avoid advertising altogether.
My opinion aligns with a combination of both views:

While advertising can be highly effective at persuading consumers, its impact is not universal and depends on factors such as the quality of the advertisement, relevance to the target audience, and the consumer's level of engagement. Effective advertising campaigns that resonate with consumers' needs, values, and aspirations have the potential to drive brand awareness, preference, and ultimately, purchasing behavior.

However, in today's hyper connected world, where consumers are constantly bombarded with advertisements, there is a risk of over saturation and diminishing returns on advertising investment. To break through the clutter and capture consumers' attention, advertisers must innovate and adapt their strategies to deliver more personalized, authentic, and meaningful experiences that cut through the noise and establish genuine connections with their audience.

In summary, while advertising can be a powerful tool for influencing consumer behavior, its effectiveness is contingent upon various factors, and marketers must navigate the challenges of a crowded marketplace to create impactful campaigns that resonate with their target audience.

#### topic

The diagram shows the procedure of manufacturing instant noodles.

#### overall feature

overall, it is clear that the the salable instant noodles is made through  eight steps  in which the different ingredients like flour, oil and water are mixed and transformed by the production line and finally the noodles are packaged.


#### specific features

Looking at the diagram more closely, one can see that the process begins when the flour is transported and stored in the silos, then the flour is sent to the mixer and be mixed with water and oil, producing dough sheets. Then, moved by the rollers, the sheets are cut into strips for the next step where these strips are rounded into noodles discs. The next step is to cook the discs with oil and dry them before they are put into cups and spilled with vegetables and spices. Then finally the cups are labelled and sealed, distributed to different places for sale.
