#### 绪论

<em><font color=red>（引入）</font></em>It is common in some culture to make children believe that nothing cant be accomplished through enough effort. <em><font color=red>（我的观点）</font></em> While it is reasonable to some extent for this argument, I firmly believe that the disadvantages affect the children much more than the advantages.

#### 本论1

<em><font color=red>（反对观点(优点)）</font></em> On the one hand, the spirit of perseverance is important to children and one simple way to help them realize its importance is by telling them to try as hard as they can. <em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em>
Some parents may resonate with this kind of behavior because education in such aspects help their children to form the value of bravely embracing the obstacle and conquering the barriers in life. In this way they also want their children to be positive towards the life they lead. Generally speaking, simple and direct as it is, telling children to never give up on one thing actually works in forming the value of children when they are small.
<em><font color=red>（举例）</font></em> For example, studies have shown that in some asian countries where competition is fierce so parents tend to make their children face the academic pressure at a very small age. Under such circumstances, to face those overwhelming issues, it is important for children to learn the significance of perseverance.


#### 本论2

<em><font color=red>（赞成观点（缺点））</font></em> Nevertheless, this way of education is rather simple and reckless without consideration of the cruel reality where try hard isn't always work. <em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em> Just as mentioned above， although at a very small age the way of telling children to try as hard as they can help the form of their value towards difficulties. It doesn't always as effective when children
grow up, like in their adolescence. Start from this time, the complexities of the world begin to unravel its mysterious mask, fabricating an immense web enveloping the future of these young learners. So metaphorically speaking, parents must grant them right tools to break through the web instead of just yelling on the other side of the web, leave a child barehanded but still require him to try as hard to struggle his way out, obviously he'll be stuck in the web.  In other words， children should be allowed to have the right to give up when failure occur and figure another way out. <em><font color=red>（举例）</font></em> For example, famous football player Robert Lewandowski born in a family where his parents play volleyball, naturally he picked up his family career at a very young age but soon found that he was not suitable for it. In some family parents could have forced their children to "persevere", neglecting the cruel fact. And when the child found that he cant be best at the thing he put so much effort in, self-questioning would come with lack of confidence. But luckily in Robert's family, his parents sent him to play football and then we  witness an extraordinary striker who can be written in history.


#### 结论

To sum up, while it is reasonable to some extent to tell a children try as hard as they can to achieve something, it is of more advantage for  children to  be taught in smarter way, rather than this simple and reckless idea.


### gpt-writing

Encouraging children to believe they can achieve anything if they try hard enough can have both advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages:

Promotes Confidence: Believing in their ability to overcome challenges through hard work and determination can boost children's self-confidence and self-esteem. This confidence can empower them to take on new tasks, set ambitious goals, and persist in the face of obstacles.

Fosters Resilience: Teaching children the value of effort and perseverance instills resilience, resilience, teaching them to bounce back from setbacks and failures. This resilience is essential for navigating life's ups and downs and developing a growth mindset that views challenges as opportunities for growth.

Encourages Goal Setting: Believing in their potential to achieve anything can motivate children to set ambitious goals and strive for excellence in various areas of their lives, whether academic, athletic, artistic, or personal. Setting and pursuing goals can cultivate a sense of purpose, direction, and fulfillment.

Empowers Independence: Instilling the belief that they have the power to shape their own destiny encourages children to take initiative, responsibility, and ownership of their actions and decisions. This empowerment fosters independence, autonomy, and a sense of agency in navigating their lives.

Disadvantages:

Unrealistic Expectations: While believing in one's abilities is important, overly optimistic messages about achieving anything can create unrealistic expectations and pressure on children to constantly succeed. This pressure can lead to stress, anxiety, and feelings of inadequacy when faced with inevitable failures or setbacks.

Risk of Entitlement: Constantly hearing messages about limitless potential and achievement regardless of effort can foster a sense of entitlement in children, leading them to expect success without putting in the necessary hard work or perseverance. This entitlement can hinder their ability to develop resilience, grit, and a strong work ethic.

Downplays Systemic Barriers: Telling children they can achieve anything if they try hard enough may overlook the systemic barriers and inequalities that exist in society, such as socioeconomic status, race, gender, and access to resources. Ignoring these barriers can perpetuate the myth of meritocracy and undermine efforts to address systemic inequities.

Fear of Failure: While resilience is important, an excessive focus on the message of "achieving anything" can instill a fear of failure in children, making them reluctant to take risks or pursue challenges for fear of falling short of unrealistic expectations. This fear of failure can stifle creativity, curiosity, and exploration.

In conclusion, while instilling a belief in children's potential to achieve anything through hard work and determination can have positive effects on their confidence, resilience, goal-setting, and independence, it's essential to balance this message with realistic expectations, acknowledgment of systemic barriers, and a healthy attitude towards failure and setbacks. Encouraging a growth mindset that values effort, learning, and resilience can empower children to navigate challenges and pursue their aspirations while recognizing the importance of perseverance and humility along the way.
