#### 绪论

<em><font color=red>（引入）</font></em> It is intriguing that nowadays businesses tend to emphasize that their products are new in some way.

<em><font color=red>（原因及个人观点）</font></em> While there are many reasons behind the phenomenon, i believe that it is a negative development because of the consequences it may bring to modern society.

#### 本论1

<em><font color=red>（主要原因）</font></em> The main cause of this phenomenon is that people are inclined to be attracted by new stuff and a product that is unique in the market is more irreplaceable to consumers.

<em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em>It is a fact that
with the third industrial revolution the development of technology is faster than any time in the history. As a result  the daily product that we use is changing day by night with new features and better functions. On top of that, the introduction of automation in the manufacturing industry also greatly increase the efficiency of production, making competition between same kind of product in the market more fierce. In order to stand out and attract more customer, businesses then try to add unique features to their product, and advertising it. <em><font color=red>（举例）</font></em> For instance, companies that produce shampoo always update their product with new element added no matter it is useful or not.


#### 本论2

<em><font color=red>（优缺点以及着重介绍缺点）</font></em> However, I think it is a negative development in many ways, such as false advertisement and inappropriate competition.
<em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em> Naturally we would deem it reasonable for technological product to update fast, such as cell phone and computers, but for other product it is skeptical that they update even every month which as a result may bring false advertisement. They may deceive to the consumers and persuade them into buying something they don't need with some useless features. <em><font color=red>（举例）</font></em>For example，sports company usually update their product every two or three month, like football boots. Fancy advertisement would be made showing the public its new outlook and new technology used on the boot to help one play better football. However, as a football fan myself, i am sure that at most time those new technology is no more than a propaganda mean and apparently it will not improve one's level but will only cost u more money.


#### 结论

To sum it up, fierce competition brought by the technology revolution lead to the over-advertisement of businesses, especially in the aspect of advertising their so-called new features. Although consumers are willing to accept new useful features, at most time they are more false advertisement or some useless functions. So in the end it is a negative development which need to be corrected by the government.




# Task 1

#### topic

The diagram below illustrates the manufacturing process for making sugar from sugar cane

#### overall feature

overall, one can see that there are totally seven steps to transform the sugar canes into sugar and the main step is evaporate which extract the sugar from the ingredient.

#### specific feature

Looking at the diagram more closely, one can see that the process begin with the growing period of about 12-18 months until they are ripe, after that the second step is harvesting which can be done by automatic machine or human labour. Next the sugar canes are sent to be crushed into juice. Then the juice goes through the limestone filter and is purified. In the fifth step, the purified juice is heated in the evaporator, extracting the syrup and vaporizing the useless substances, after that the syrup is centrifuged, separating the sugar crystal from it. Finally the sugar is dried and cooled which is the final product.
