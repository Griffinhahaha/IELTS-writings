# Task 2

**Many manufactured food and drink products contain high level of sugar, which causes many health problems. Sugar products should be made more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar**

**Do u agree or disagree?**


#### 绪论

<em><font color=red>（引入）</font></em> It is generally acknowledged that high amount of sugar in daily consumption leads to many health problem,  which evokes a debate on whether to raise the price of sugar products in order to diminish the sugar consumption.

<em><font color=red>（我的观点）</font></em> From my perspective, although useful it may seem in a short period, I believe this measure is outrages and irresponsible in the long run.


#### 本论1

<em><font color=red>（原因1）</font></em> To begin with， by simply making sugar products expensive, the stability of market could be disrupted for it defies the laws of economics.
<em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em>One of the most basic rules that regulate the domestic economy is that the market adjust the price itself， some may argue that macro control by government is also significant, which help stabilize the market when its internal regulation stop functioning. However, it is not suitable in this case, because the price of sugar products is stable and to change it could bring fluctuation in the food market, affecting the price of not only sugar products, but also more other  daily consumption. So apparently it is unreasonable to rise the price of sugar. 



#### 本论2

<em><font color=red>（原因2）</font></em> On top of that,  rise in price of sugar products not only affect the consumers but also exert a great implication on farmers who grow sugar plant such as sugar canes. <em><font color=red>（一般性陈述）</font></em>The fact is that their income will not increase along with the price of sugar products, because the price changes without the proper regulation of market but is intervened by external adjustment.  <em><font color=red>（举例）</font></em> Take china in the early stage of last century as an example, when the sellers put up the price of rice to get more profit. As a result, the market corrupt and the farmer didn't get their legitimate income. This wo some extent verifies the idea that macro control should only be used to stabilize the market instead of changing the current acceptable situation.


#### 结论

To sum it up， raising the price of sugar products not only affects the stability of market but also harm the profits of farmers, therefore the government should find more reasonable and useful ways to help people consume sugar wisely.
